# ECOVision: Gamifying Recycling for a Sustainable Future

## The Problem We're Tackling

In 2018, the EPA reported that 94% of Americans had access to recycling programs. Sounds great, but there's a catch: our national recycling rate was only 32.1%.

This gap between access and action is the core issue. We have the bins, but we're not using them enough. Why?

- Lack of awareness and motivation, especially among young people
- Difficulty finding recycling bins when out and about
- No real incentive to recycle consistently

These factors create a disconnect between having recycling programs and actually using them.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to gamify the recycling process, engage adolescents, and contribute to world sustainability goals. In practice, this means:

- Boosting recycling rates among young people by making it fun and rewarding
- Educating users about the impact of their efforts
- Building a community of environmentally-conscious youth
- Aligning with global sustainability goals, promoting responsible consumption and waste management

ECO Vision isn't just an app, it's a movement to transform how the next generation approaches recycling and environmental responsibility.
